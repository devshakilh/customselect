# Custom Select Component

This project implements a reusable and modular custom Select component built with React and Vite. The component provides a user-friendly, accessible dropdown interface with options for single-select and multi-select modes. Additionally, the dropdown includes a search functionality to filter options based on user input. 

## Features
**Single-select and Multi-select**: This option allows users to select a single option or multiple options based on the configuration.
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Users can search through options to quickly locate their desired selection(s).
- **Customizable**: Configurable props for labels, options, selection type (single/multiple), and other settings.
- **Accessible**: Designed with accessibility in mind, using semantic HTML and keyboard navigability.
- **Unobstructed Dropdown**: Ensures any other element on the page does not cover the dropdown.
